                Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms,
                 or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications,
                 and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms

            <h2>Mobile Development Using Android</h2>
            <p>
                This section describes how to build a simple Android app. First, you learn how to create a "Hello, World!" project with Android Studio and run it. Then, you create a new interface for the app that takes user input and switches to a new screen in the app to display it.
                Before you start, there are two fundamental concepts that you need to understand about Android apps: how they provide multiple entry points, and how they adapt to different devices.

            <p>
                Cross-platform mobile app development is the process of creating mobile apps that can be deployed or published on multiple platforms using a single codebase, 
                instead of having to develop the app multiple times using the respective native technologies for each platform.Cross-platform development tools allow you to write your code once then export your app to many operating systems and platforms without having to create a dedicated app for every single platform.
